## 👋 About Me

I am an enthusiastic and detail-oriented IT and Cybersecurity professional with over 23+ years of service in the U.S. Army, where I developed a strong foundation in discipline, leadership, and operational security. My military experience has instilled in me a mission-first mindset, adaptability in high-pressure environments, and a commitment to excellence.
I hold **CompTIA Security+** and **Google Cybersecurity** certifications, equipping me with up-to-date industry knowledge and practical security skills. I’m eager to transition into a challenging entry-level cybersecurity role where I can contribute to strengthening organizational security while continuing to grow professionally.
Additionally, my background in creative writing and film has sharpened my ability to think critically, solve complex problems creatively, and communicate technical concepts clearly to diverse audiences.
